### Progress status:

Pre-calculations - 100%

Board - 100% (17-23 mil. nodes/s)

Engine - 6% (a/b pruning for test purposes + need to fix some things)

Eval - 10% (really weak for now)

Interface - 2% (some functions, including driver one)

### Game samples (God have mercy):

### Current plans:

0. Autotests

1. Better eval

2. Iterative deepening

3. Even more tests
