First edition.

It works, but... there's still a long road ahead!

Approx. CCRL rating: 1750

### Progress status:

Pre-calculations - Complete!

Board - Complete! (~24m nps on perft)

Engine - Complete! (~300k to 800k nps; Inspired by: BBC engine, shoutout to https://github.com/maksimKorzh)

Eval - Complete! (Inspired by: Kaissa engine, also used PeSTO eval)

Comms - Partially complete (Musthave features work, xboard protocol only)

### TODO:

Full xboard (CECP v2) and/or UCI support

Resolve issues (incompatibilities, enhancements, there are a lot)

Opening books, endgame tables support

### Game samples:

https://lichess.org/XoSX7uBB/white/ (40/900 vs BBC 1.2 as White)

https://lichess.org/pb7SE6Bk/black/ (40/900 vs BBC 1.2 as Black)

https://lichess.org/2A4kaKhR/ (40/6 vs self, hyperbullet basically)

### "I want to play against it!"

1. Download and install xboard (WinBoard) or any interface with CECP v2 protocol supported

2. Add Akira CE latest .exe from github releases (e.g. http://hgm.nubati.net/xboard/winboard/help/html/20.htm)

3. Enjoy!

I'll deploy it as a lichess bot sooner or later.

### Is it really 'First' edition though?

Nope. https://github.com/N1ckn1ght/CCE

But we won't count this one.
